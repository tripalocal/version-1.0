      <h3>Discover Melbourne's Street Art Laneways with Felicity O.</h3>
      <p>– Melbourne CBD</p>
        <p>Hi everyone, my name is Felicity. A born and bred Melbournian,  I love the 'culture capital of Australia', especially the internationally recognised thriving network of laneways and street art.</p>
        <p> I will spend 1.5 – 2 hours to take you on a journey to discover my four to five of my favourite street art laneways in the Melbourne CBD. Along the way, as an art lover, I will take you into the world of stencil art, sticker art, poster art and trends in the street art movement. I want to share with you my love of colour, movement and passion for Melbourne's street art. Hopefully, by the end of the walk, some of my love for Melbourne would have rubbed off on you!</p>
        <p>Please wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for all sorts of weather (Melbourne has 4 seasons in a day!) so it is best to bring an umbrella and a jacket.</p>

      <h3>Stories Behind Melbourne's Historical Architecture with Felix V.</h3>
      <p>– Melbourne CBD</p>
        <p>I'm a Melbourne local, born and bred. Outside of my work as a coffee consultant, my passion lies with Melbourne's historical buildings.</p>
        <p>Together, we will explore Melbourne as it is today and understand it's past. We can start off with a coffee in one of Melbourne's renowned cafes before trekking off on foot or by tram. I will share the unknown stories behind some of my favourite architecture and how they turn Melbourne into the amazing place that it is today.</p>
        <p>Through this experience, you will uncover the past of the city, much of which is hidden in plain sight. It would be a pleasure to show others the place I call home.</p>
        <p>A good pair of walking shoes will come in handy. If the weather isn't kind, it's nothing that an umbrella or a tram ride cannot fix. Any food or coffees are excluded in the experiences price.</p>

      <h3>Hidden Contemporary Art Galleries with Yeok W.</h3>
      <p>– Inner Northern Surburbs, inner Southern Surburbs and/or Melbourne CBD</p>
        <p>I am a visual artist who exhibits regularly in Melbourne. I am very interested in the art scene in Melbourne and know many contemporary galleries in Melbourne with the focus on pop surrealism and illustrations.</p>
        <p>I invite you to join me in the Melbourne city to experience the contemporary art scene and discover the many hidden art galleries Melbourne has to offer. We will start in the mid to late afternoon for a couple of art gallery openings, stop for a quick bite at a local eatery before finishing off the evening with a couple more art gallery openings. Of course, I can cater to your personal interests and time constraints. At the galleries, you will feel the vibe of the Melbourne contemporary artist community and perhaps even meet the artists themselves! As an artist, I will share my views of the exhibits and the techniques. By the end of the experience, you will have seen a side of Melbourne that is all too often hidden and many have missed!</p>

        <p>Hello there! I hail from the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne and work in the Melbourne CBD.

So let me introduce you to some of my favourite live shows in the Melbourne CBD and/or in the inner north. If you have preferences for certain genres, let me know too and I can customise the experience to suit your tastes. I hope you leave Melbourne with an insight into Melbourne's live entertainment scene and a taste of what this culture capital has on offer. </p>

      <h3>Explore Melbourne Start-ups with Lauren B.</h3>
      <p>– Melbourne CBD</p>
        <p>So you want to meet the innovators and disruptive business leaders of Australia? You want to see where they work and have a chat with a few of them? Well, Melbourne is the place to find it! Tucked neatly into the cafe culture and painted laneways are some of the cutting edge entrepreneurs that are moving this country onto the international startup stage. </p>
        <p>I'd love to take you to a few of the many co-working spaces around the greater Melbourne area based on your business interests and current information/networking goals. If the timing works out I can also take you to one of the hundreds networking events that take place in this vibrant community every month (no boring pitch nights, promise!). Please contact me with a bit about what industries and/or stages of growth you are interested in or any example of startups you would like to learn more about and I will provide you with a choice of three itineraries. Transit costs included if you are happy to travel on public transport or else a personal driver can be arranged for an additional cost.</p>

      <h3>Asian Street Food Experience with Cherry L.</h3>
      <p>– Melbourne CBD</p>
        <p>I'm a food enthusiast, always excited about fresh tastes on my palate. Apart from my job as a physiotherapist, I love cooking. As people travel, food culture travels with them. Street food in particular is the most down-to-earth version of a country's food culture.</p>
        <p>I have lived in Melbourne for 7 years, most of which is spent in the inner city area. I find Melbourne CBD to be one of the best places to sample some of the most authentic Asian street food. I will take you on a short trip on foot to explore some of the hidden gems in Melbourne city that offer great taste and fill you in on the street food culture. Also I'll share some of my personal tricks that allow you to replicate some of the yumminess in your own kitchen! So come join me on a trip that will change your mind about Asian food, and I assure you that there is more than just yumcha and sushi!</p>
        <p>Please note that the experience fees do not include the price of the street food. While buying is not compulsory, all items are under $10</p>
