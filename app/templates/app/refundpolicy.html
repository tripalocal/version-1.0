                <h1>Traveller Refund Policy</h1>
                <p>Last Updated: December 28, 2014</p>
                <p>These terms and conditions govern the Tripalocal Traveller Refund Policy (the "Traveller Refund Policy") available to Travellers who book and pay services related to the Hosts through the Tripalocal platform (the "Site") and suffer a Travel Issue and the obligations of the Host associated with the Traveller Refund Policy.</p>
                <p><strong>REFUNDS AND CANCELLATION FOR YOUR EXPERIENCE LED BY TRIPALOCAL HOSTS</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1. Travel Issue </strong></p>
                <p> A "Travel Issue" means any one of the following:</p>
                <p>a) The Host of the Experience (i) cancels a reservation within 24 hours before the scheduled start of the reservation, (ii) fails to arrive for the Experience within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time, or (iii) fails to provide the Traveller with the reasonable ability to access the Experience (e.g., by allowing the Traveller access to the space in which the Experience will happen or begin if applicable).</p>
                <p>b) The description of the Experience in the listing on the Site is materially inaccurate with respect to (i) the duration of the Experience, (ii) the content of the Experience (including but not limited to the stated activities or sites, as applicable), or (iii) the physical location of the Experience. c) During the Traveller's Experience, conditions do not meet safety or health hazards that would be reasonably expected, given the nature of the particular Experience, in Tripalocal's judgment.</p>
                <p><strong>2. The Traveller Refund Policy
                </strong></p>
                <p>If you are a Traveller and suffer a Travel Issue, we agree, at our discretion, to either (i) reimburse you up to the amount paid by you through the Site, as determined by Tripalocal in our discretion, depending on the nature of the Travel Issue suffered or (ii) use our reasonable efforts to find and book you another Experience which in our determination is reasonably comparable to the Experience described in your original reservation in terms of content and quality. For clarity, in the event the alternative Experience is of a higher price than the former, you may be responsible for any difference in price. In the event the alternative Experience is of a lower price, you may be entitled to a partial refund for the difference. All determinations of Tripalocal with respect to the Traveller Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund, shall be final and binding on the Travellers and Hosts.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Conditions to Claim a Travel Issue
                </strong></p>
                <p>Only a Traveller may submit a claim for a Travel Issue. If you are a Traveller, in order to submit a valid claim for a Travel Issue and receive the benefits with respect to your reservation, you are required to meet each of the following conditions:</p>
                <p>a) You must report the Travel Issue to Tripalocal in writing (at enquiries@tripalocal.com) and provide us with information (including evidence) about the Experience and the circumstances of the Travel Issue within 24 hours after the start of your reservation, and must respond to any requests by us for additional information or cooperation on the Travel Issue;          </p>
                <p>b) You must not have directly or indirectly caused the Travel Issue (through your action, omission or negligence); and          </p>
                <p>c) You must have used reasonable efforts to try to remedy the circumstances of the Travel Issue with the Host prior to making a claim for a Travel Issue (and you must provide evidence of having done so). </p>
                <p><strong>4. Minimum Quality Standards, Host Responsibilities and Reimbursement to Traveller
                </strong></p>
                <p> If you are a Host, you are responsible for ensuring that the Experiences you list on the Site meet minimum quality standards regarding adequacy of the description on the Site, safety, health, and do not present a Traveller with Travel Issues. Throughout the Experience, Hosts should be available in order to try, in good faith, to resolve Traveller issues.</p>
                <p>If you are a Host, and if (i) Tripalocal determines that a Traveller has suffered a Travel Issue related to an Experience listed by you and (ii) Tripalocal either reimburses that Traveller any amount up to the amount paid by the Traveller through the Site for the Experience or provides an alternative Experience to the Traveller, you agree to reimburse Tripalocal up to the amount paid by Tripalocal within 30 days of Tripalocal's request. All determinations of Tripalocal with respect to the Traveller Refund Policy, including without limitation the size of any refund to the Traveller, shall be final and binding on the Travellers and Hosts. You also agree that in order for you to reimburse Tripalocal up to the amount paid by Tripalocal, Tripalocal may off-set or reduce any amounts owed by Tripalocal to you by this amount. If the Traveller is rescheduled to an alternative Experience, you may lose part or all of the payment for the booking and you may be responsible for reasonable additional costs incurred to reschedule the Traveller to the alternative Experience.</p>
                <p>The rights of the Travellers under the Traveller Refund Policy supersede the cancellation policy that otherwise applies to a particular Experience. If you dispute the Travel Issue you may notify us in writing (enquiries@tripalocal.com) and provide us with information (including evidence) disputing the claims regarding the Travel Issue, provided you must have used reasonable and good faith efforts to try to remedy the Travel Issue with the Traveller prior to disputing the Travel Issue claim (and you must provide evidence of having done so). You agree that all determinations of Tripalocal with respect to the Travel Issue shall be final and binding on the Travellers and Hosts regardless of your submission of a dispute against such </p>
                <p>Travel Issue. In the event of one or more
                    Travel Issues, Tripalocal, in its discretion, may elect to take additional actions. These actions include, but are not limited to, negatively affecting your listing ranking, automated reviews or notifications indicating Travel Issues, canceling future bookings, suspending or removing the listing of the Experience or imposing penalties or fees for the administrative burden associated with the Travel Issues.</p>
                <p><strong>5. General Provisions
                </strong></p>
                <p>a) No Assignment/No Insurance. This Traveller Refund Policy is not intended to constitute an offer to insure, does not constitute insurance or an insurance contract, does not take the place of insurance obtained or obtainable by the Traveller, and the Traveller has not paid any premium in respect of the Traveller Refund Policy. The benefits provided under this Traveller Refund Policy are not assignable or transferable by you.</p>
                <p>b) Modification or Termination. Tripalocal reserves the right to modify or terminate this Traveller Refund Policy, at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice.          </p>
                <p>c) If Tripalocal modifies this Traveller Refund Policy, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification and Tripalocal will continue to process all claims for Travel Issues made prior to the effective date of the modification.          </p>
                <p>d) Entire Agreement and Definitions. This Traveller Refund Policy constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Tripalocal and you regarding the Traveller Refund Policy and supersedes and replaces any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Tripalocal and you regarding the Traveller Refund Policy. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Tripalocal Terms of Service. Controlling Law. This Traveller Refund Policy will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Victoria and the Commonwealth of Australia, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.</p>
                <p>e) Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL TRIPALOCAL'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRIPALOCAL POLICY TERMS, EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE TOTAL PAYMENT COLLECTED BY TRIPALOCAL FROM THE TRAVELLER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY POSTING A LISTING OR BOOKING AN EXPERIENCE OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE, SERVICES AS A HOST OR TRAVELLER, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE POLICY TERMS.</p>
